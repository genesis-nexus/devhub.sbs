                    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3>
                    <p>We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us when you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Subscribe to our newsletter</li>
                        <li>Contact us through our contact forms or social media</li>

                        <li>Leave comments on our blog posts</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This information may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Name</li>

                        <li>Any other information you choose to provide</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>1.2 Information Automatically Collected</h3>
                    <p>When you visit our Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device and browsing behavior, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> IP address, browser type and version, operating system, device type</li>
                        <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> Pages visited, time spent on pages, links clicked, referring website</li>

                    <h3>1.3 Tool Usage Data</h3>
                    <p><strong>Important Privacy Feature:</strong> Most of our developer tools (Base64 encoder/decoder, URL encoder/decoder, JSON validator, JWT decoder, Hash generator, etc.) process data entirely in your browser using JavaScript. This means:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your data never leaves your device</li>
                        <li>We do not store, log, or transmit the content you encode, decode, or validate</li>
                        <li>All processing happens client-side for maximum privacy</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For certain features that require server-side processing (such as the OIDC playground), we may temporarily process data but do not store it permanently.</p>
