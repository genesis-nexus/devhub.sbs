                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>DevHub was born out of the frustration many developers face: constantly searching for reliable tools scattered across dozens of websites, dealing with intrusive ads, mandatory sign-ups, and limited functionality. We asked ourselves, "What if there was one place where developers could find everything they need, completely free, with no barriers?"</p>

                    <p>That question led to the creation of DevHub in 2024. What started as a simple collection of encoding tools has evolved into a comprehensive developer portal serving thousands of developers worldwide. Our growth has been driven by one principle: listening to our community and building what developers actually need.</p>
